#Rules for naming variables:
    1. Must start with lowercase or underscore
    2. Can contain lowercase, uppercase, numbers, underscore
    3. Must not contain spaces
    4. Must not overwrite pre defined keywords

#Constant
    --> These values should not be changed
    --> convention is to use Uppercase for naming constants
    --> eg PI = 3.14

#Two rapidly assign values
a,b,c = 1,2,3
print(a) #1
print(b) #2
print(c) #3
